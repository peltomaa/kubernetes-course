## Most likely used (circled blue in image below)

- Go programming language
  - Many of tooling most likely uses go under the hood. It's popular programming language in infrastructure. I think Rancher is built with Go programming langauge
- Remote procedure call
  - I'm not sure, but I would expect apps that I've been using using them.
- Databases
  - Most likely I've used numerous databases during my time using the software. The software data needs to stored somewhere
